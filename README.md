Object Tracking using OpenCV
This repository provides a simple implementation of object tracking using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. Object tracking is a crucial component in various applications, such as surveillance, video analysis, and autonomous vehicles.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV (install using pip install opencv-python)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-tracking-cv2.git
cd object-tracking-cv2

Usage
Run the object tracking script:

bash
Copy code
python object_tracking.py
This script uses OpenCV to perform object tracking on a sample video. You can customize the input video by modifying the video_path variable in the script.

Features
Object Tracking Algorithms:

This repository includes multiple object tracking algorithms available in OpenCV, such as BOOSTING, MIL, KCF, CSRT, and MOSSE.
Easily switch between algorithms by modifying the tracker_type variable in the script.
User Interaction:

The script allows users to draw a bounding box around the object to be tracked.
Press the 'Enter' key to start the tracking.
Performance Metrics:

Evaluate the tracking performance by displaying metrics such as Frames Per Second (FPS) and tracking status.
